        Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho
       Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago 
       as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the 
        rugged beauty of the river that they never left.

        Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah
       Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty 
       Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs 
       from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric
       and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
